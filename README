For our project we will be making an interactive dashboard using the data from https://crcns.org/data-sets/pfc. These data look at the prefrontal cortex in the brain, through different areas. We will provide a menu with a toggle down option for these different areas and with each option will provide graphs and information explaining these graphs to the user so they can understand the specific brain area and function more completely.
